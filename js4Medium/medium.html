    <p>MEDIUM: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

        You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
        
        You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
        
        Hint:  Use a function. Use the built in method .indexOf( ) and/or  for loops. Review your lesson on Arrays to aid in working through this problem. 
        
        Example 1:
        
        Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
        
        Output: 4
        
        Example 2:
        
        Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
        
        Output: -1.
